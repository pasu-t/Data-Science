Remember: In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content, so if this is your first time creating a database, you should complete the next two chapters (create collection and create document) before you check if the database exists!

Important: In MongoDB, a collection is not created until it gets content!
MongoDB waits until you have inserted a document before it actually creates the collection.
