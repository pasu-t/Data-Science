NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

-> Central object: numpy array
-> More like vector/matrix
-> Most importantly, they are optimized for speed
-> Can do addition, substraction, multiplication etc

-for loops in python are very slow when you do mathematical operation.
