Binomial distribution is used when there are exactly two outcomes of a trial. These outcomes are labeled as “Success” and “Failure”.

Here the probability of both the outcomes is the same for all the trials.

Each trial is independent since the outcome of the previous toss doesn’t determine or affect the outcome of the current toss. An experiment with only two possible outcomes repeated n number of times is called binomial. The parameters of a binomial distribution are n and p where n is the total number of trials and p is the probability of success in each trial.


Bernoulli Distribution is a special case of Binomial Distribution with a single trial.

The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution having two possible outcomes that is, 0 and 1, where 
n = 1  (usually called a “success”) occurs with probability p and 
n = 0 (usually called a “failure”) occurs with probability q = 1–p, where 0 < p < 1.
