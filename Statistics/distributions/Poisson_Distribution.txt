The Poisson Distribution is a discrete probability distribution which states that the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space conditionally that the value of an average number of occurrence of the event is known.

The Poisson Distribution results from a Poissonâ€™s Experiments which states that for a series of discrete event where the average time between events is known, but the exact timing of events is random.

Poisson distribution vs. Binomial

If your question has an average probability of an event happening per unit (i.e. per unit of time, cycle, event) and you want to find probability of a certain number of events happening in a period of time (or number of events), then use the Poisson Distribution.
If you are given an exact probability and you want to find the probability of the event happening a certain number out times out of x (i.e. 10 times out of 100, or 99 times out of 1000), use the Binomial Distribution formula.
