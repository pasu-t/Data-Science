DB Server: which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or
	   to computers as defined by client-server-model.

DB Tables: A table is a collection of related data held in table format within a database.

DB table view: a view is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. 
		This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary.

Primary Key: is a field in a table which uniquely identfies each row/record in a database table.
		-Cannot have NULL values
		-A table can have only one primary key, which may consists of single or multiple fields

Secondary Key: is the key that has not been selected to be the primary key. However it is considered as candidate key for the primary key. Candidate key is an attribute or set of attributes that you can consider as primary key.

Foreign Key: is a column or group of columns in a relation DB table that provides a link between between two tables.
