-> R programming is used for descriptive statistics, statistical inference, testing of hypothesis, theory of probability, probability distributions and time series forecasting

why R with respect to other tools in the market?
 -> Aprt from being a best statistical language, it can also be used as a programming language for data analytics
 -> Is also one of the most popular tools used for data visualization.
 -> simple and easy to learn read & write
 -> free and open source

Note: R programming is may not be helpful for developing deep learning models
	  R works very well when your data size is less than or equal to one million data series
