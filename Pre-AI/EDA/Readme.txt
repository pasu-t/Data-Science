The Data Science Method(DSM)
1. Problem identification
2. Data collection, Organization and Definitions
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Pre-processing and Training Data Development
5. Fit Models with Training Data Set
6. Review Model Outcomes--Iterate over additional models as needed
7. Identify the final model
8. Apply the Model to the Complete Data Set
9. Review the results--Share your findings
10. Finalize Code and Documentation

EDA:

    step number 3 in DSM assumes that both steps one and two already been completed.At this point, you have a well-structured and defined hypothesis or problem description. The model development dataset is up and ready to be explored and your early data cleaning steps are already completed. At a minimum, you have one column per variable and have a clear understanding of your response variable.

    Based on step two in the DSM you have already revieved the following items about each variable in your data.
    1. Column Name
    2. The range of Values or Codes
    3. Data Type
    4. Description of Column
    5. Count or percent per unique Value or Code
    6. Number if NA or missing value

    Substeps in EDA(In general):
    1. Data Cleaning (fill missing value, drop duplicate rows and columns)
    2. Build data profile --tables and plots (Reviewing summary statistics)
    3. Explore data relationships (through covariance matrices and other methods, data corelation coefficients)
    4. Identification and creation of features (building principle complenents for feature evalution)

    SUMMARY
    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is often an iterative process where you pose a question, review the data, and develop further questions to investigate before beginning model development work.
