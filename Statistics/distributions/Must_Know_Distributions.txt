#Probability
Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur in a Random Experiment.

#Distribution
In statistics when we use the term Distribution it usually means Probability distribution.

A Distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

Or A Probability Distribution is a mathematical function that can be thought of as providing the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment.

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to draw conclusions of properties of an underlying probability distribution.

Do Not misunderstand that the Distribution is a graph. Distribution is defined by the underlying probability and not the graph.

Types of distribution:
Descrete
Continuous
Probability

Descrete: 
Bernoulliâ€™s Distribution
Binomial Distribution
Uniform Distribution
Poisson Distribution

Continuous:
Normal distribution
Exponential distribution

Special cases:
Gibbs
Maxwell etc
